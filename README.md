# Prevalence_PPV
An RShiny app to demonstrate the relationship between prevalence of a disease and the positive predictive value (PPV) of the diagnostic/screening test for the same disease.
The sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic/screening test are the most commonly used metrics to evaluate the accuracy of the test. Both these metrics do not depend on the distribution or prevalence of the disease in population. However, in actual clinical practice, it is imperative that you are cognizant of the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test. This is because it is PPV which tells you the probability of having the disease if at all you are tested positive. PPV depends not just on the sensitivity and specificity of the test, but also on the prevalence of the disease. This is a remarkable property that leads to the phenomenon of having low PPV in scenarios where the disease of interest is having a low prevalence. In case of very low-prevalent diseases, the PPV would still be low even if the tests are near-perfect
The inherent relationship between PPV and prevalence can be visualized by plotting the post-test probability of disease against the pre-test probability of the disease. The post-test probability of the disease is the conditional probability of having the disease given the output of the test (negative or positive). Thus, post-test probability of disease when the test is positive is nothing but the PPV. The post-test probability of disease when the test is negative is equal to the compliment of negative predictive value (100-NPV%). The pre-test probability, on the other hand, is the probability of the disease in general population before you do any test. Intuitively this equates to the prevalence of the disease.
